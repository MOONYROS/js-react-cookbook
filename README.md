# Cookbook app in React JS

## General information

This application lets the user create and edit his own cookbook, meaning that the intended use is to write and edit cooking recipes.

My main intention with this project was to create myself first small and simple application and learn the basics of development in **[React](https://react.dev/)** and **Javascript**.
I also used **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** to have a lot smaller package while working on this project.

Because this is a small project, the app works just on basic arrays. There is no database or anything smarter installed or in use. So please keep in mind that if you close the app, you'll lose all the previously made progress.

The design of the application was made from scratch without using any css frameworks. That is one of the reasons why the application is not responsive.

## How to run this application

* Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
* Clone this repository.
* **In the root directory**, run `npm install` or `npm i` (shorter version).
* Then you can run `npm run dev` to run the application on a local server in your browser.

For further info on how to use this app, please visit the Documentation by clicking the documentation button where the use of the app is explained.

## Warning

* I have to emphasize that I made this application as a learner project, so some parts of the code might not be exactly corectly written as it should be for a React project. Please keep that in mind if you're a learner too before copying any part of this code.
* Also the application design **is not responsive** and it might not look well on every device.
