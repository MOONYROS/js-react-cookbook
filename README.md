# Cookbook app in React JS

## General information

This application lets the user create and edit his own cookbook, meaning that the intended use is to write and edit cooking recipes.

My main intention with this project was to create myself first small and simple application and learn the basics of development in **[React](https://react.dev/)**.
I also used **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** to have a lot smaller package while working on this project.

## How to run this application

* Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
* Clone this repository.
* **In the root directory**, run `npm install` or `npm i` (shorter version).
* Then you can run `npm run dev` to run the application on a local server in your browser.

## Warning

* I have to emphasize that I made this application as a learner project, so some parts of the code might not be exactly coorectly written. Please keep that in mind if you're a learner too before copying any part of this code.
* Also the application design **is not responsive** and it might not look well on every device.
